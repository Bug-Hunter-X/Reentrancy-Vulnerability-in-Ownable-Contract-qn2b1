# Reentrancy Vulnerability in Ownable Contract

This repository demonstrates a common reentrancy vulnerability in a simple Ownable contract written in Solidity.  The vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit the contract by calling another function within the `transferOwnership` function before the ownership is properly updated.

## Vulnerability

The `transferOwnership` function lacks the necessary protection against reentrancy.  A malicious contract could call back into the Ownable contract during the transfer process, potentially manipulating the state before the ownership is updated.

## Solution

The solution involves using a reentrancy guard (e.g., a mutex) or a checks-effects-interactions pattern to prevent this type of attack. The provided solution demonstrates the use of a checks-effects-interactions pattern.
